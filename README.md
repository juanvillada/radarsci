# RadarSci

RadarSci, a radar for scientific literature, is a Typer-powered CLI that keeps laboratory teams up to date with the latest, most relevant papers from the journals they care about. It queries the Europe PMC literature service for the chosen journals, scores candidates using the supplied keywords, and renders either a sleek terminal table or a minimalist HTML report with clickable cards.

## Requirements

- [pixi](https://pixi.sh) 0.48 or newer (dependency manager)

All runtime dependencies are specified in `pixi.toml`. No `pip` steps required.

## Quick start

```bash
# Solve the environment once
pixi install

# Show usage information
pixi run radarsci --help

# Scan the default journals with a 30-day window and CLI output
pixi run radarsci
```

## Custom searches

- Add more keywords by repeating `--keyword/-k`.
- Choose journals by repeating `--journal/-j` with either the predefined keys (see table below) or any journal title recognised by Europe PMC (e.g. `"The ISME Journal"`).
- Use `--journal all` to include every built-in journal in a single run.
- Control freshness with `--days/-d` (0 disables the date filter).
- Choose the ordering strategy with `--sort` (`score`, `recency`, or `journal`).
- Trim the list with `--limit/-n`.
- Generate a minimalist HTML report with `--format web --output path/to/report.html`.
- Results always include the requested keywords; papers with zero keyword matches are filtered out automatically.
- Use `--coverage full` when you only want papers that match every keyword.
- Use `--skip-journal/-skip` to exclude specific journals (handy with `--journal all`).

Example:

```bash
pixi run radarsci \
  --keyword metagenomics \
  --journal nature-microbiology \
  --journal cell-systems \
  --journal science \
  --limit 90 \
  --days 360 \
  --format web \
  --output outputs/metagenomics.html
```

All built-in journals in one go:

```bash
pixi run radarsci \
  --keyword metagenomics \
  --journal all \
  --limit 30 \
  --days 20 \
  --sort score \
  --coverage all \
  --format web \
  --output outputs/metagenomics.html
```

## CLI options at a glance

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--keyword/-k TEXT` | Add one or more search keywords (repeatable). |
| `--journal/-j TEXT` | Restrict to a journal key/name (repeatable). Use `all` to scan every built-in journal. |
| `--limit/-n INT` | Maximum number of results to include (default 12). |
| `--days/-d INT` | Only include papers published in the last N days; `0` disables the cutoff. |
| `--sort TEXT` | Sorting mode: `score` (default), `recency`, or `journal`. |
| `--coverage TEXT` | Coverage filter: `all` (default) shows every match level; `full` keeps only full keyword matches. |
| `--format TEXT` | Output mode: `cli` (default) or `web`. |
| `--skip-journal/-skip TEXT` | Exclude a journal key/name from the search (repeatable). |
| `--output PATH` | Destination for the HTML report; omit to auto-generate a timestamped file. |

## How relevance works

RadarSci blends three signals for each returned article:

1. Keyword density, with extra weight when terms appear in the title or abstract.
2. Europe PMC's relevance score for the underlying query.
3. A recency boost that depends on how many days ago the work was published.

The precise scoring function is:

```
S = 6 * T + 2.5 * B + 4 * M + (R / 10) + 6 * F + 4 / (1 + D)
```

Where:

- `T` = number of keyword hits in the title.
- `B` = number of keyword hits in the title + abstract (case-insensitive).
- `M` = number of distinct query keywords that appear at least once.
- `R` = Europe PMC relevance score from the API response (0 when unavailable).
- `D` = days since publication (0 for same-day releases; if unknown, the recency terms are omitted).
- `F` = max(0, 1 - min(D, W) / W) with `W = max(requested_days, 30)` - a freshness factor bounded between 0 and 1.

The final score is rounded to two decimals. Scores and the associated `D` ("days ago") are displayed in both the CLI and HTML reports.

By default, RadarSci sorts by decreasing score and, within ties, by increasing `D`. Use `--sort recency` to prioritise fresher items or `--sort journal` to group by journal name.

Articles are grouped per journal and interleaved to guarantee that every requested journal is represented before the overall limit is reached. Remaining slots (if any) are backfilled by the highest-scoring papers regardless of journal.

## Data source

- RadarSci uses the [Europe PMC REST API](https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService) to perform `(keyword1 OR keyword2 ...) AND JOURNAL:"name"` searches with an optional publication date window.
- Returned metadata (title, authors, abstract, DOI, relevance score) is normalised and stored locally in memory only.
- Europe PMC requires no API keys, but we ship a descriptive `User-Agent` so that traffic is easy to attribute.

## Project layout

- `src/radarsci/cli.py` - Typer command definition and orchestration.
- `src/radarsci/fetcher.py` - Europe PMC queries and response normalisation.
- `src/radarsci/relevance.py` - Relevance scoring heuristics.
- `src/radarsci/reporting.py` - Rich terminal table and HTML rendering.
- `pixi.toml` - Environment + task configuration.

## Notes

- The CLI uses a rich progress bar while contacting Europe PMC; network access is required.
- HTML reports are self-contained and easy to share.
- The project stays Python-only for maximum portability. Contributions are welcome!
